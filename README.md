## Project description (Embedded Systems Course, assignment):
### Electronic coffee maker
<br />
1. The system must have a character display to view and adjust the parameters of the form.
<br />
2. This machine contains 4 types of coffee:
<br />
(A) First type of coffee: This coffee needs 20 seconds to prepare.
<br />
(B) Second type of coffee: This coffee needs 30 seconds to prepare.
<br />
(C) Third type of coffee: This coffee needs 50 seconds to prepare.
<br />
(D) Fourth type of coffee: This coffee needs 60 seconds to be ready.
<br />
3. We also have 3 types of glasses: standard, large, very large. And the user is free to choose any of these 3
Choose the type of glass. If you choose a large glass, the amount of time required in 2.1 and if
Choosing a very large glass, the time required is multiplied by 5.1.
<br />
4. This system has two tanks, a water tank and a milk tank, and initially the amount of each is 1 liter. The amount of water needed to make all the coffees is 90 cc. In case of
Choosing large coffee, this amount is multiplied by 2.1, very large coffee, this amount is multiplied by 5.1.
<br />
5. If the user chooses to add some milk at the end of this operation,
a value of 10 seconds is also added to this operation. The amount of milk consumed regardless of the type of glass
It is 70 cc.
<br />
6. In case of lack of necessary resources to make coffee, an error message should be shown to the user.
<br />
7. Also, while making coffee, the remaining time should be shown on the screen.
Perform each step while making coffee.And also at the end of the operation should
write that your coffee is ready.
<br />
8. If the operation is finished, the coffee can be taken by pressing a button so that the next person can make coffee.
